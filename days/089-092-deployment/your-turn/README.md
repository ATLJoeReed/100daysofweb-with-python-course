# Days 89 - 92 Deploying web applications on Linux

In this your-turn, you'll jump back to the original app we built part way through our unit testing journey where the view models have been created but before any tests were written. You will add unit tests to the three levels of our app: view models (data exchange and validation), views (the actual view methods directly), and function (the app as a whole).

## Day 1: Watch the video lessons

The first day of this 4-day block is to watch the videos. Feel free to play around with the sample code and other projects while going through the videos. There is a lot of content here but we want to spend one day per type of test for the remaining three days so try to get through it in one here.

## Day 2: Test the viewmodels with `unittest` and `mock.patch`

## Day 3: View tests

## Day 4: View tests
